# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React 18+ related to the cleanup function in the `useEffect` hook.  Under certain conditions, particularly when the component unmounts quickly or encounters an error, the cleanup function might not be executed, leading to potential resource leaks or unexpected behavior.

## Problem
The `useEffect` hook's cleanup function is essential for releasing resources or cleaning up after side effects. However, if a component unmounts before the cleanup function can run (e.g., due to a navigation change or an error), the cleanup function is skipped.

## Solution
The solution involves a more robust approach to managing cleanup, such as using `useUnmount` or ensuring that cleanup actions are handled even during unmounting.  This example uses a try-catch block to handle potential errors and ensure that cleanup is attempted.
